## Office energy consumption 

Make sure it is impossible to have the Airco or radiator on while also having the window open. 
Block the hottest setting of the radiators and hand out NLeSC sweaters for people that need more insulation. 
Do not use Haskell 

 

## Office resource consumption 
Get rid of the whole printing forms just to sign them and then scanning them again 
Make sure old furniture and devices are not thrown away but reused.  

 

## Commuting 

Reflect on necessity of weekly travelling to PI location. A two monthly sprint may be much more efficient. 
Encourage cycle /walking commuting and/or discourage car commuting. 


## Food 

Ban all food products from lunch that contain palm oil (=rain forest cuts),  
Less animal products at lunch 
Organic products

## Investments 
Check that the Bank NLeSC uses is climate friendly or switch to a bank like Triodos. Same for other financial service providers. 

 

## Green NLeSC process and outreach 
Collaborate with others at science park to collect knowledge and share experiences around this topic. 
Think about how we can make sure the whole escience center feels involved in this and people don't just feel that they get restrictions on their personal preferences (like eating meat, feeling warm and traveling by car) by "those annoying green extremists" 
Collaborate with the IS-enes projectâ€™s Carbon Footprint group 
Agree on how to implement the changes mentioned above 

 

## Office IT & laptops 
Allow, encourage repair & replacement of batteries and other components 
Prefer repairable and upgradeable laptops
